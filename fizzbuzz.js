Fizzbuzz is a program used to demonstrate basic functionality of a programming language.

The Fizzbuzz program is to go through numbers 1 through 100. Printing the following:
"fizz" for numbers divisible by 3;
"buzz" for divisibles of 5s;
and "fizzbuzz" (fizz + buzz) of both.

print ðŸ‘½ and the number if it is divisible by 3
print ðŸš€ and the number if it is divisible by 5
print ðŸ›° and the number if it is divisible by both 3 and 5
print ðŸ’© and the number if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5

In JS, Comments are written with // for inlines, and /* multiliners * /.
// for programs over 200 lines of code.
Like a mix of C and CSS, ahahaha.
